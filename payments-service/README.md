# Payments Service ðŸ’³

This service is a specialist dedicated to handling all the logic for modern payment channels. Its primary role is to **orchestrate** the entire lifecycle of a payment transaction, from initiation to completion, without holding the core financial ledger itself.

It integrates with external payment networks (like UPI) and communicates with the internal **Core Banking Adapter** to ensure transactions are processed reliably and safely.

## Core Functionality: Transaction Orchestration

The service implements a robust orchestration pattern that follows these key steps, as detailed in the system's sequence diagrams:
1.  **Initiation**: Receives a payment request from the API Gateway.
2.  **Funds Hold**: Communicates with the **Core Banking Adapter** to verify funds and place a temporary hold.
3.  **External Processing**: Interacts with external payment networks (e.g., a mock NPCI/UPI client) to process the transaction.
4.  **Finalization**: Once external confirmation is received, it instructs the **Core Banking Adapter** to finalize the debit from the customer's account.
5.  **Logging**: Every step of this process is meticulously logged within the transaction's own document in the database for auditing and tracking.

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose (for flexible, high-volume transaction logs)
- **Communication**: Synchronous REST APIs

## API Endpoints

### `POST /payments`
Initiates a new payment transaction and starts the orchestration process.

* **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "UPI",
      "amount": 150.00,
      "currency": "INR",
      "payer": { "accountId": "ACC001", "vpa": "user@okbank" },
      "payee": { "accountId": "ACC002", "vpa": "merchant@okbank" }
    }
    ```
* **Success Response (201 Created)**: Returns the final transaction object with a status of `SUCCESS`.
* **Failure Response (500 Internal Server Error)**: Returns the transaction object with a status of `FAILED` and details about the failure.

### `GET /payments/:transactionId/status`
Retrieves the complete details and current status of a specific transaction, including its orchestration log.

* **URL Parameter**:
    * `transactionId`: The unique ID of the transaction.
* **Success Response (200 OK)**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "data": { ...full transaction object... }
    }
    ```

### `GET /health`
A simple health check endpoint to verify the service is running.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

* `PORT`: The port for the service to run on (e.g., 3002).
* `DATABASE_URL`: The MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb://mongodb:27017/payments-service`).
* `CORE_BANKING_SERVICE_URL`: The internal URL for the Core Banking Adapter (e.g., `http://core-banking-adapter:3005`).

## Running Locally

### For Development
This command uses `ts-node` to run the TypeScript code directly.
```bash
